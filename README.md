# Online-Computer-Shop-
The program is designed for an online computer shop to facilitate the purchase of customized personal computers. The shop offers a basic set of computer components priced at $200, and customers have the option to choose additional items from various categories like computer cases, RAM, hard disk drives, solid-state drives, optical drives, and operating systems. The program utilizes arrays to store item information, including item codes, descriptions, and prices. 

Customers are prompted to select one computer case, one RAM, and one main hard disk drive. The program calculates the total price by adding the costs of the chosen items to the basic set. Afterward, customers can decide whether they want to purchase additional items. 

If additional items are chosen, customers can select from a range of computer accessories. The program allows customers to add multiple items and keeps track of the total price. Importantly, the program also applies discounts based on the number of additional items selected. If a customer purchases only one additional item, they receive a 5% discount, and for two or more additional items, a 10% discount is applied. 

The program displays a summary of the chosen items and their individual costs. For additional items, it shows the discount applied, the amount of money saved, and the new total price after the discount. This comprehensive system simplifies the customization and ordering process, enhancing the shopping experience for customers while providing transparency regarding discounts and costs.
